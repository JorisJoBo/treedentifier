# Treedentifier
Treedentifier allows you to identify trees in your country. The algorithm can learn
what the characteristics of a specific tree species are and detect them when
properly learned. For the development of this algorithm we use LIDAR data of the Netherlands.

## Setup
### Software
After cloning the project, please install the required python packages first.
For this project we use Python 3.6. If you don't have python already, you can
download it [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-364/).
To install the required packages, just execute:
```
pip install -r python-requirements.txt
```

To process the LAZ files in which most LiDAR datasets are formatted, you can
use LAStools. You can download LAStools [here](https://rapidlasso.com/lastools/).
Please note that LAStools is not free. You can use LAStools without paying but it will
distort your data and insert black diagonals in LAScanopy.

### Datasets
After that, you'll need a vegetation dataset of your area, as well as a filtered
and a unfiltered LiDAR dataset. We used the [Dutch Vegetation Database](https://www.gbif.org/dataset/740df67d-5663-41a2-9d12-33ec33876c47)
as our vegetation dataset and as LiDAR data we used [filtered AHN2 data](http://geodata.nationaalgeoregister.nl/ahn2/atom/ahn2_gefilterd.xml)
and [unfiltered AHN2 data](http://geodata.nationaalgeoregister.nl/ahn2/atom/ahn2_uitgefilterd.xml).

### Processing data
To be able to use this data in our algorithm, we need to do some preprocessing first.

#### Preparing the vegetation datasets
The vegetation dataset contains a lot of different plants. Since we are only
interested in trees, we need to remove all non-trees. In the file treespecies,
you can find a list of trees extracted from the Dutch Vegetation Database.

To extract all trees from the vegetation dataset, you can run 'forest-filter.py'.
```
python forest-filter.py
```
Please note that this file looks for the 'joined_db2.csv' file, so you'll have to name your
vegetation dataset like this. This python program will create a new file called
'forest_filter_result.csv' for you. This will contain all trees found in the
vegetation database.

Then, if you want to extract all dominant trees from the dataset, you can run dominant-filter.py.
Which will take the 'forest_filter_result.csv' file created in the previous step and
will generate a new 'dominant_trees.csv' file.
```
python dominant-filter.py
```

After that, you can run 'coordinate-filter.py' to extract the coordinates of the trees.
```
python coordinate-filter.py dominant_trees.csv
```
Please note: it is necessary to provide the 'dominant_trees.csv' file as an argument.

Now you can run all LAStools you want. We set up a default batch script which will
basically work for everyone. Just run the batch file and you should be fine. You'll need the output
of the 'coordinate-filter.py' step, for the last LAStools step 'LAScanopy'.

When done with LAStools run 'data-connector.py' to combine the dominant trees
and the result matrix of LAScanopy.
```
python data-connector.py combined_canopy.csv dominant_trees.csv
```
(The 'combined_canopy.csv' file in the command above is the output file of the
LAScanopy step).

Now you're done with the setup. You now should be able to run the main algorithm
without any problems.

## Contributing
### Testing
You have to test your code first before pushing. Pushing while failing to do so, may result in failed builds.
For testing you should use [PyCodeStyle](https://github.com/PyCQA/pycodestyle).
You can test your code with the following command:
```
pycodestyle --show-source --show-pep8 ./
```
If you want, you can let [autopep8](https://github.com/hhatto/autopep8) fix your issues with the following command:
```
autopep8 --in-place --aggressive --aggressive -r ./
```
